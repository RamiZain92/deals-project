In this scenario, you are a member of a Scrum team working on the development of a data warehouse for Bloomberg, with the primary goal of enabling comprehensive analysis of Foreign Exchange (FX) deals. One of the key customer stories within this project is the requirement to accept detailed FX deal information from external sources and persist this data into a relational database (DB).

In summary, this customer story and project context emphasize the crucial role of data validation, data integrity, and reliability in the context of a financial data warehouse. It also highlights the need to ensure that FX deals are accurately stored and analyzed while minimizing the risk of duplicate or erroneous data. The team's work involves not only the development of the database and storage mechanism but also the creation of a robust validation and import process to meet the specific needs of Bloomberg.
